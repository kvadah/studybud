StudyBud my first ever Django project is a community-based web application built with Django where users can create discussion rooms, join conversations, and share knowledge on various topics.

This project is primarily designed as a learning journey for mastering Django backend development — covering models, authentication, relationships, templates, and deployment.

 Features

 Home Page — Displays all discussion rooms with filtering by topic or name
 Room Discussions — Users can join any room and post messages
 CRUD Operations — Create, update, and delete rooms or messages
 User Authentication — Login, register, and logout functionality
 User Profiles — View and edit profile information and activity
 Search Functionality — Quickly find rooms or topics
 Dynamic Relationships — Each room is linked to a host and topic
 Responsive Frontend — Styled using HTML, CSS, and Django templates

The technologies I am using developing this project:-
Backend: Django (Python)

Database: SQLite (default, easily switchable to PostgreSQL/MySQL)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (Django Templates)

Authentication: Django’s built-in user system

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Learning Objectives
This project was developed as part of my Django learning path to understand:
Django’s Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture
Handling database models and relationships
Building authentication and authorization systems
Implementing CRUD operations
Structuring clean and maintainable Django projects
